# Features

Glitch Chat's quite cool, so here's a list of the features it has. OMG; they are a lot.

* Using emojis like :) or ;) will turn them into their real forms (it has a bunch of other emoji saved too)
* You can close the pane using a handy button on the bottom toolbar if you need more room while coding.
* Whenever someone sends you a message, it will send a little sound! If the pane is closed, a red sign will appear at the bottom toolbar telling you how many messages your group has sent you.
* It doesn’t matter what theme you use, the chatbox will still work.
* See who said what
* You can see who just joined and disconnected.
* 100% security, we don’t get your private information
* Has tracking, to disable it use /config debug_mode=true
* We have secured everything and now it is not possible to inject CSS/HTML/JS (v. 3.9.0)
* Allows guest messages
* Anyone can join with the bookmarklet
* Even if you disconnect, the messages will be saved
* Automated Bot
* Various shortcuts
* There’s a game (type /bot game)
* Type /bot rickroll to get a rickroll link
