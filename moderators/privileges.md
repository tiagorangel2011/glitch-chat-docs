# Moderator privileges
Here's a list of privileged you have as a moderator:

#### 1. QUICK SHORTCUTS
We thank you for being a moderator, not you, but anyway, being a moderator has those boring things.

For example writing things like "Oh Jhon, you have breaked the community rules! We recommend you to review our T&Cs and doing that and this. Please stop that thing and start that thing etc. etc.".
And you have more live than moderation. So, just send this handy shortcuts and they will transform into a beutiful text!
