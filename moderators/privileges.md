# Moderator privileges
Here's a list of privileged you have as a moderator:

## 1. Quick shortcuts
We thank you for being a moderator, not you, but anyway, being a moderator has those boring things.

For example writing things like "Oh Jhon, you have breaked the community rules! We recommend you to review our T&Cs and doing that and this. Please stop that thing and start that thing etc. etc.".
And you have more live than moderation. So, just send this handy shortcuts and they will transform into a beutiful text!

* **/shortcut respect**: Please respect the community. We ask you to visit our T&Cs available at our website. Take this warning seriously. Contact "[FROM] ♦" for more information about this warning.
* **/shortcut letuswork**: Oh hi & welcome to the chat! But we're working now, can you please don't send much messages?
* **/shortcut hi**: Welcome to the chat! Read the initial message to know more about how this works, or get started! Contact us if you need any help 😁
* **/shortcut report**: Hey please stop. If you continue like that, I will need to report you to @Glitch.com.
For more information, contact "[FROM] ♦".
