# Moderators

Moderators are a new way of moderation in Glitch Chat, a feature requested by a lot of people.  
You should respect moderators.  
But wait, not what you are expecting. Mods can't delete messages or do other things. We're still working in it, but basicaly being a mod adds a little star next to your profile name like this:

![Moderator star](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70700766/185793400-b3debdd8-7af8-42ca-8654-da53961b4dae.png)

Notice it? It's quite similiar to stackoverflow's one.

The little star is yellow on our new update.

We don't want to make a "moderators can do anything" and "i wanna get mod at all cost" and things like that, so we will simplify this.

# Can I be a mod?
The following people can be a moderator:

* Anyone that actively participates in the project and have a trust level of basic or more in the support forum
* Anyone that works at Glitch.com
* Anyone that has requested authorization using the "be a mod" form
