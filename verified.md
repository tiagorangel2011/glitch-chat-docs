# Getting verified
In the new BETA version, we're changing "moderators" to "verified" people. That makes it much easier to tell people what actually are "mods".    
It's easy to recognize a moderator. Simply look for the ![verified blue check](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70700766/204149690-9db4e9e5-97a7-4109-969c-19a13ba1e60c.png) sign on the user profile
Please note that this feature is still BETA and we're working on it.
