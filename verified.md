# Getting verified
In the new BETA version, we're changing "moderators" to "verified" people. That makes it much easier to tell people what actually are "mods".    
It's easy to recognize a moderator. Simply look for a blue checkmark sign on the user profile
Please note that this feature is still BETA and we're working on it.
